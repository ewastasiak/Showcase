		Converted a static project of a browser-based card memory game to an interactive one. It required modifying JavaScript, HTML and CSS starter files.<br> This project is featured on <a href="https://google-udacity-scholars18.github.io/fend/">Nanodegree Students Showcase page</a>. I chose to submit this particular assignment, third out of eight, because, sweet lard on a cracker, adjusting my brain to use JavaScript was hard. I'm really proud I made past this point.
