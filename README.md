This Jekyll page was set up using a [step-by-step tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) by Jonathan McGlone.

The page will get styled and filled to the brim with junk. Soonâ„¢.


## TODOs:

0. Remove template-y dad jokes from content. 
1. Add media queries.
2. Picture presentation is a mess. Clean up that mess. Decide on something. I dunno. Just fix it.
3. Oh, and add lightbox while you're at it.
